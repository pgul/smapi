There are some BeOS-Specified changes/extension and after adding Filetyping
and Attribute support it is time to write a litte readme ! ;)

'cause there is no filelocking-support on OS-Level under BeOS it is a 
problem to use Squish-Style areas under BeOS (you CAN use alternativ locking, 
but is is slow).
Todays OS's have normaly no problems with directorys with large numer of 
files - BeOS is such an OS, so you can use SDM-Style Areas without slowing 
down your filesystem. 

In SDM-Areas each message is written in a seperate file. Each Area is one
directory with a number of files (=messages).

When you use SDM-Areas under BeOS smapi will use filetyping (message/fmsg) and
attributes:

XMSG:FROM  - the sender himself
XMSG:TO    - the recieptent
XMSG:SUBJ  - the subject
XMSG:DATE  - the date (& time) of submission
XMSG:DTAR  - the date (& time) of arrival

More attributes (flags, adresses) will be added soon.

If you want to use attributes you must add the FileType "message/fmsg" in 
"Preferences/FileTypes" and add the extra attributes above. (In future there
will be a script to do this)
From now you can use this attributs in the Tracker. Try it !

If you want to use querys, you can add some indicies:

mkindex -t string XMSG:FROM
mkindex -t string XMSG:TO
mkindex -t string XMSG:SUBJ
mkindex -t llong  XMSG:DATE
mkindex -t llong  XMSG:DTAR

You can add all 5 or less indicies. If you don't want to query via the subject,
don't add the index. If you don't want to query via From-Name or To-Name, 
don't add these indicies, etc.

So, today (11-02-2001) there is no application associated with the filetype
"message/fmsg", so you can't view the message-text - but this will change
in the next weeks ! ;)

Now go and make some good apps !
