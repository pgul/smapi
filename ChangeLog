The following is a list of bug fixes and new features since SMAPI 1.1.

SMAPI 1.2
---------

- MSGAPI32.DLL and MSGAPINT.DLL have been removed from the SMAPI archive.

- SMAPI now supports compilation using the DJGPP compiler.  (Courtesy
  Alexander Aganichev.)

- The Linux, EMX and FreeBSD makefiles now utilise compiler optimisation
  when creating the SMAPI library.


SMAPI 1.3
---------

- Major bug fix: Under some circumstances SMAPI would create a corrupted
  index entry when a new message was added to a Squish base.  This was
  caused by a misunderstanding of a small section of code, which in turn
  caused the library to read from the wrong position of an array.  This
  has been corrected.

- Bug fix: Due to a structure alignment problem, the Linux, FreeBSD and
  DJGPP versions of SMAPI would corrupt the date_written and date_arrived
  fields on newly created messages.  Due to the layout of Squish message
  base format, this may have also caused corruption to the message
  threading of the newly created message.  Fixed.

- Various minor code modifications intended to make SMAPI more reliable
  under some error conditions.

- A makefile for IBM C/Set++ for OS/2 2.0 is now included; MAKEFILE.IBO.

- Various minor modifications to support compilation of a native Windows
  NT library.  A makefile for WATCOM C/C++ for Windows NT 10.x is now
  included; MAKEFILE.WCW.

- The makefile for the Microsoft QuickC library now uses the Microsoft
  Macro Assembler, MASM.  The Borland Turbo Assembler, TASM, may be used
  if you do not have MASM.

SMAPI 1.4
---------

- Removed all structure layout and endianness dependencies.  SMAPI should
  now work under every operating system now matter how obscure it may
  internally represent integers or pack structures.  #pragma pack()
  statements are no longer necessary, they are only left in for backward
  compatibility.

- Added a makefile for the RSXNT/EMX/GCC package and some RSXNT specific
  code. In particular, I had to rename the FindClose routine to FFindClose
  in order to avoid a name clash with the Windows API. I also renamed
  FindOpen and FindNext to FFindOpen and FFindNext.

- y2k fixes and other fixes

- rights patch for created directories and files.

SMAPI 1.6.0
----------

- Adapted msgapi for Jam message base. Need check and test.
