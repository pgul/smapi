Please read the files (especially README.Makefiles) in the
husky-common (huskybse) package FIRST!

Unix:
-----

1. Put the smapi package in the directory where the other packages of fido
   linux reside:

   /usr/src/packages/        -> smapi/
                             -> fidoconfig/
                             -> hpt/
                             -> htick/
                             ...some other

2. Determine which makefile you need to use then compile and install fidoconfig
   using selected makefile, as following examples:
   Ex.1 (use common makefile (named 'Makefile'): require huskymak.cfg):
	$ make
	$ make install
   Ex.2 (use platfom-specific makefile):
	$ make -f makefile.lnx
	$ make -f makefile.lnx install

3. (For UNIXes only) Ensure /usr/local/lib/ is in /etc/ld.so.conf

4. (For UNIXes only) Execute ldconfig as root

5. Write a fido config according to the proposal which is also in this package.
   If your are just some normal point, give the shell script fidoInst a
   chance. Always test the config with the tparser tool, which you can place
   in a directory like /usr/local/bin.

You're ready. Now you can install software which uses smapi.
