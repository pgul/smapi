smapi for Debian
----------------

smapi is based on Squish MSGAPI0 from Scott J. Dudley.
Look in readme.txt and license.txt !

Future Development of smapi is done by the Husky-Team. More Information 
over Husky is at http://husky.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de/

I have made only one binary package and not a lib and a dev-Package. Its too
small :)
